Now that I started writing short essays, I'd like to use this momentum to write more often. 

The great thing about short essays is that they can be written quickly without much thought. There's no need to rewrite sentences over and over. The objective here is just share ideas that I find interesting.

That being said, today I'd like to talk about my summer schedule. By this point, my life can be summarized by a series of rules and systems that help me stay sane and healthy. Perhaps one of the most important systems is my schedule. 

Despite what most people might think, my life still quite chaotic. That's just the way the universe works. However, I think I'm doing a good job in keeping the chaos under control.

My schedule is not something set in stone, it usually changes each season-ish. This variability is mainly due to Spain's weather. We have hot summers and cold winters. 

This is the schedule I'm following now:
- 7:00 Wake up
- 7:00 - 8:00 Workout (outside) + stretching
- 8:00 - 9:00 Daily Gameplan
    * Take care of my plants
    * Journal (basically vomit my thoughts)
    * Check my calendar + schedule free slots
- 9:00 - 14:00 Work using pomodoros (50min work - 10min rest)
- 14:00 - 15:00 Lunch
    * Something light such as fruit, nuts, yogurt, cereal...
    * Big launches made me tired every time
- 15:00 - 17:00 Focused work (without pomodoros)
- 17:00 - 17:30 Close work (sometimes later)
    * Write down how the day went
    * Close pending tasks
    * Leave notes for Future Andres
- 17:30 - 20:00 Personal projects
    * Plan content for Instagram
    * Read/Write about AI
    * Cook something fancy
    * Home automation
    * [Insert random personal project]
- 20:00 - 21:00 Dinner
    * Something nutritious and balanced
    * Sweets time! I treat myself to something sweet and special, usually with tons of chocolate
- 21:00 - 22:00 Mindless time
    * Instagram
    * Youtube
    * Videogames
    * Socialize?
- 22:00 - 23:00 Screen-less time
    * Hot shower
    * Meditate
    * Journal
- 23:00 Bedtime

By looking at this, you can easily tell that I'm quite addicted to work. Perhaps I am, either way I have tons of fun every day. 

Two more thoughts before closing this post:
- Do NOT copy this schedule. Design your own schedule based on activities you like.
- Be realistic and flexible. Schedules provide a blueprint structure for your day. Some day you might not be able to cross all the items, that's fine. My "success" rate is about 30-40% (being highly optimistic). 

Remember, life is chaotic, that's something you cannot control. Do your best every day, that's what you CAN control.

Thanks for your time.
