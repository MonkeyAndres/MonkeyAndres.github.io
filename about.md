> Read more about what I'm currently working on in the [now page.](../now)

Hello, my name is Andres Martin Angulo I'm a self-taught developer with +3 years of experience in web development. Apart from software development, I enjoy simple activities such as cooking, reading, writing and practicing calisthenics. I like to keep my mind active with challenges all the time.

I'm also a very curious person who likes to research from time to time about topics such as nutrition, personal finance, sports, productivity, etc. The objective of this blog is to share the insight of my researches and my own ideas.

That being said, you can imagine that this blog will be full of random posts without any relation between them, and you aren't very wrong about it.

You can see all the projects that I'm currently working on [here](../now). Yep, I'm working on a lot of things in parallel, that's completely fine, isn't it?

Okay, not bad, that could be used as an introduction. Thanks for reading.
