Hello, my name is Andres Martin Angulo... and that's all I have to say. Thanks for reading, bye.

Okay, no, let's try again...I've always been a person who finds it difficult to talk about himself but today I'm going to give it a shot.

First of all, I'm a software developer, mostly self-educated, since a very young age I've been amazed about computers and how they work and that leads me to my actual job as a Javascript Developer at [Redradix](https://redradix.com/).

Apart from the fact of being a developer, I'm a very curious person who likes to research from time to time about topics such as nutrition, personal finance, sports, productivity...

That being said you can imagine that this blog will be full of random posts without any relation between them and you aren't very wrong about it.

You can see all the projects that I'm currently working on [here](../now). Yep, I'm working on a lot of things in parallel, that's completely fine, isn't it?

Okay, not bad, that could be used as an introduction. Thanks for reading.
