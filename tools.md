#### Software

Tech
- **OS**: [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/), simple, robust and works out of the box.
- **Coding**: [Virtual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), it's very slow but like the plugins and the integrated debugger.

Organization
- **Personal Wiki**: [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) used to document personal areas of my life.
- **Second brain**: I maintain a Zettelkasten using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). The main purpose is to organize knowledge and later share it in this blog.
- **Personal cloud**: self hosted [Nextcloud](https://github.com/nextcloud/server) instance used as calendar and contacts server.
- **Quick notes**: [Nextcloud Notes](https://github.com/nextcloud/notes) although I'm not very confortable with the UI/UX of it.
- **Task management**: [org-mode](https://orgmode.org/) I've been trying it out and I'm pretty impressed already. Furthermore, I'm planning to migrate my personal wiki to org-mode.

Multimedia
- **Music**: Apple Music, on my desktops I use [Cider](https://cider.sh/)
- **Movies/Shows tracker**: [Trackt](https://trakt.tv/) very convenient for recommending movies and keeping a watchlist.

Other
- **Email**: [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/) encrypted mail and easy to use UI.
- **Password manager**: [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) easy to use with a lot of apps for all platforms.
- **WebApp organiser**: [Ferdium](https://ferdium.org/) the single most useful app I have on my computers.
- **Expenses manager**: [Dime](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dime-budgets-and-expenses/id1635280255) minimal and elegant UI without ads (only iOS)

#### Hardware

- **Laptop**: HP Pavilion x360 (i5 7200U + 8GB RAM + 256GB SSD)
- **Phone**: iPhone XR 64GB
- **Smartwatch**: Apple Watch Series 4
- **Tablet**: iPad Mini 5
